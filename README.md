This is a ToDo List application, where users can able to do CRUD Operations for their task. Here, CRUD stands for Create,Read, Update and Delete.

In this application, I used some languages to built. They are:

-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-Node js
-MYSQL


Some of the packages installed for Node js are:

-express
-multer
-mysql
-ejs
